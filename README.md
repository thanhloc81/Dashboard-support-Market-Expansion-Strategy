### 2. Strategic Product Selection:

- **Strategic Products:**
  - Focus on high-revenue, high-efficiency products that ensure stability and growth, such as **_Copiers_**, **_Machines_**, **_Bookcases_**, **_Chairs_**, and **_Phones_**, due to their consistent orders (5-10 months) and high profit margins.
  - Trending products with high growth and affordable average order values like **_Labels_**, **_Accessories_**, and **_Binders_** should be leveraged to quickly penetrate new markets.

- **Recommendations:**
  - Maintain and develop technology and furniture products, as they significantly contribute to revenue and profit. Promote stable, high-value products in existing markets to strengthen the company's presence.
  - Adjust strategies for products in the **_Table_** category to improve sales, such as pricing or promotional strategies, due to high average prices and limited sales months, resulting in a negative profit rate.

### 3. Market Expansion Strategy:
- **Current Markets:**
  - Continue to develop **APAC**, **US**, and **EU** markets with steady revenue growth (***20-40%***). Use analyzed strategic products to deepen market penetration and expansion.
